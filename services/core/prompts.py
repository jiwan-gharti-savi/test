Step 1: identify all the entities from the text ####current invention####. Print the output of this step in the following format: ==Entities== Entity 1, Entity 2 etc. 

Step 2: Identify all the specific numerical attributes, specific properties (including physical properties such as state, texture, etc. and particular examples), specific quantities associated with each/every entity from the output of Step 1.

Step 3: Use quantification for the entities identified as given in the examples 1 below
  Examples 1:
  Entity: processor  
  Quantification - one or more processors or at least one processor or a computer system that includes a processor
  Entity: file system 
  Quantification: one or more file system 
  Entity: computer-readable media  
  Quantification: one or more computer-readable media
  Entity: components  
  Quantification: plurality of components 
  Entity: modules  
  Quantification: plurality of modules or one or more modules
Use this format for output: ==Quantification for the entities== Entity 1 -> Quantification for Entity 1, Entity 2 -> Quantification for Entity 2....

Step 4: Generalise the language for all the entities from Step 1 in context of text ####current invention####. Ensure the generalised language while broadening the scope of action retains the technical essence in context of #### current invention #### and is not vague. Use this format for Output: ==Generalized Entities== Specific Entity 1-> generalised Entity 1, Specific Entity 2-> generalised Entity 2 etc. 

Step 5: Identify all the direct and indirect entity actions of all the entities from Step 1 using text ####current invention####. Generalise the language for all entity actions from text ####current invention####. Ensure the generalised language while broadening the scope of action retains the technical essence in context of ####current invention#### and is not vague. Use specifics for the entity actions from text ####current invention#### where necessary to avoid being vague. Use this format for output: ==Entity Actions== Entity 1-> Action 1 -> generalised language for Action 1, Entity 1-> Action 2-> generalised language for Action 2 etc. 

Step 6: Identify the novelty of the invention from text ####current invention####. Identify entity actions from novelty that are necessary entity actions and entity actions that are optional. Use inputs for entities from Step 4, entity properties/attributes/quantities from Step 2 and inputs for entity actions from Step 5.  Print the output in the following format: ==Novelty==, ==Necessary features==,  ==Optional features==

Step 7: Determine the entity actions from Step 5, that are necessary in context of the novelty from Step 6. Use this format for output: Entity 1-> Entity 1 action, entity 2-> entity 2 action etc.

Step 8: Determine the additional features/actions of the entities from Step 5 and entity attributes/properties/quantities from Step 2 not covered in step 7. Use this format for output: Entity 1-> Entity 1 action, Entity 2-> entity 2 action etc.

Step 8.1: Co-relate the all the specific numerical attributes, specific properties (including physical properties such as state, texture, etc. and particular examples), specific quantities associated with each/every entity from Step 2 with the generalised entities from Step 4. Include all the details from Step 2. Output: generalised entity 1-> attribute/property etc from Step 2, generalised entity 2:-> attribute/property etc. from Step 2 etc. 

Step 9: You are a patent attorney. Your aim is to draft patent claims for text ####current invention#### by following Steps 10 to 29. When drafting claims, use the generalised language for entities from Step 4 and generalised language for entity actions from Step 5 without being vague. Use quantification of entities from Step 3. When writing a claim it is important to describe how the various entities are structured and how the various entities interact and connect.

Step 10: Draft independent claims for a method/system/ process/ apparatus/machine/device/product/composition etc. in context of novelty of the invention from the output of Step 6 using only the necessary features from  the output of step 6. Use the generalised language for entities and entity actions from Step 4 and Step 5 to write the claim without being vague. 

Step 11: Draft additional independent claims for larger systems, using only the necessary features from Step 6, that encompass the invention to enhance damages in litigation. Use the generalised language for entities from Step 4 and generalised entity actions from Step 5 to write the claim without being vague. 

Step 12: Ensure independent claims are truly independent and not dependent on other claims. It is not allowed for Independent claims to reference any other claims. 

Step 13: For defining the borders of the invention with detailing and specificity, there can be the addition of dependent claims. Remember that dependent claims should specify the generalised entities and generalised entity actions in independent claims and not be vague. The dependent claims should add specificity and specific details for entities and entity actions than done in the independent claims in context of the invention and not be vague. They should not repeat/recite entity actions mentioned in the independent claims. Use inputs from Step 2, Step 7 and Step 8, Step 8.1 for this.  

Step 14: Write additional dependent claims using the additional features/actions of entities from Step 8 and not covered in the independent claims. Do not miss out on introducing any additional feature/action of entity in the dependent claim in context of the invention. Ensure specificity when reciting the features/actions from Step 8 used/in context of text ####current invention####. Use inputs from Step 2, Step 7 and Step 8, Step 8.1 for this.  

Step 15: Please generate multiple dependent claims specifying the multiple possible ways for performing the entity actions in independent claims. Ensure they are not vague and specifically state specific entity characteristics/properties/actions/quantities. Etc. Use inputs from Step 2, Step 7 and Step 8, Step 8.1 for this.  

Step 16: Ensure the dependent claims reference the relevant claim on which it is dependent. Ensure dependent claims reference only 1 claim on which it is dependent. Referencing more than one claim is not allowed.  

Step 17: Aim for 20 total claims with 3 being independent to avoid additional fees.

Step 18: Avoid "means for" or "steps" in claims to prevent invoking par. 112 issues.

Step 19:  Replace terms like "mechanism", "element", or "member" with terms conveying specific functions such as "coupler", "support", or "detector."

Step 20: Provide antecedent basis for entities used in claims and introduce features properly before reciting their functionality. Every entity or noun in the claim, when introduced, should be introduced by an article usually "a" or "an" and not article "the", except when introduced as a plurality or as "means".  When introducing plurality, avoid the use of article "the". Every subsequent reference to a previously introduced entity should be prefaced "the" or "said" (some practitioners use "said" to refer to entities, and "the" for other features). Adjectives may be dropped in subsequent references of entities only if the reference to the entity is unambiguous: "supporting member" can be later referenced as "said member", but if the invention also includes an "oscillating member", subsequent references should be "said supporting member" and "said oscillating member". Importantly, do not add limiting adjectives in subsequent references as given in the example ("said horizontally supporting member"). A claim may rely on itself for antecedent basis (e.g.: "a handle connected to the gear, the handle being axially aligned with the support member")

Step 21:  In claims with multiple options, use "or" instead of "and" for clarity and proper scope. 

Step 22:  Limit method claims to entity actions, not structures, and ensure dependent method claims are based on entity actions. Ensure the method claims are not vague. 

Step 23:  If entity actions from Step 5 recites quantities, use approximation or range to convey the quantities in claims to broaden claim scope without being vague. Example 1: Avoid stating quantity of a polymer as a “specific percentage of a polymer” as it is vague. Example 2: Avoid stating the property of an entity by stating “possesses a certain degree of that property” as it is vague

Step 24: Avoid subjective language or language lacking measurable quantities in claims. 

Step 25:  Specify forces or quantities exerted on particular elements for clarity. 

Step 26: Remove redundant or unnecessary dependent claims. 

Step 27:  Review and edit claims for proper punctuation and formatting

Step 28: Group all claims in the proper order. Order all claims that depend on an independent claim before the next independent claim. 

Step 29: Avoid patent profanities such as:
29.1 Do not use words such as "Preferably" or "Such As": These words imply that the element of the claim that follows isn't essential, and this could be interpreted to mean that it could be left out altogether. This may make it easier for a competitor to avoid infringement.
29.2 Do not use words such as "Necessary" or "Important": This could imply that without this element, the invention would not work. This could limit the claim to only those situations where that element is present.
29.3 Do not use "And/Or": This phrase can create ambiguity because it's not clear whether it means "and", "or", or both.
29.4 Do Not use the word "About": This word can create uncertainty because it's not clear how much variation is allowed.
29.5 Do not use "consists" of or "consisting of" and use "comprises" or "comprising" instead. The word "comprises" is often interpreted to mean "includes but is not limited to", and it generally does not limit the scope of a claim to the elements listed.  In contrast, "consists" or "consisting of" is more limiting and typically restricts the claim to the elements listed.
29.6 Do not use words such as: "absolute", "such as", "all", "each", "every ", "always" "never", "same", "identical", "exact", "minimum", "maximum", "no other", "only", "important", "critical", "essential", "required", "must", "Necessary"
29.7 Avoid words that are too vague and too exact:  "could", "might", "large", "small", "heavy", "above", "below", "right", "left", "superior", "inferior", "unique" etc.,
29.8    Avoid negative limitations, for example avoid using "without" and "not"
29.9  When describing a  quantity or number etc. try to add: "substantially" or "approximately", "about"
29.10 Avoid use of words like: "having", "including", "characterizing", "adapted to" or "adapted for" or "capable of"
29.11 Avoid annotations in claims to indicate a sequential order of steps. Do not annotate steps in a claim with language like "Step 1", "Step 2" etc. or "a", "b", "c" etc. Order of steps should not be specified to indicate a sequence of steps. 
29.12 In cases where multiple options are available, avoid the use of "or" or "and" between the options. Instead, qualify the options with "at least one a or b or c" or "one or more of a or b or c".

Step 16: Choose the layout for output from Step 15. Use graph TB for a top-down layout or graph LR for a left-right layout. Do not print output for this step.

Step 17: Define the nodes for output from Step 15. Use square brackets for regular nodes e.g., 100["Node A"].  Use curly braces for decision nodes e.g., 102{"Condition B"}. Treat "If" condition nodes as decision nodes. Use node numbers from Step 17. Do not print output for this step.

Step 18: For the Mermaid script/syntax from step 15 define the links/paths between nodes from Step 17 using -->. To add text to the links/paths, use |Link text|. For multiple links/paths between nodes, define each link separately. For decision making link/path, use appropriate messages to handle yes/no cases. For example, a decision node should have two separate links/paths with messages as "yes" and "no". Do not print output for this step.

Step 1 : identify all the entities from the text ####current invention####. 

Entity

Step 3: Identify all the direct and indirect actions of all entities from Step 1 using text #### current invention#### with all the details of their actions and the entities they act upon either directly or indirectly from text ####current invention####. Generalise the language for all entity actions from text #### current invention ####. Ensure the generalised language retains the technical essence in context of #### current invention ####. Use this format for output - Specific Entity 1-> Specific Entity 1 Action 1 with details, Specific Entity 2-> Specific Entity 2 Action 2 with details etc. 

Entity Action

Step 4: Suggest 10 distinct objects/devices/components/parts/compositions/ranges for every entity from Step 1 from the real world that can embody/manifest the specific entity actions for each/every/all specific Entities from Step 3 in context of text ####current invention####. Output: Specific Entity 1-> object/device for specific entity 1 etc, Specific Entity 2-> object/device for specific entity 2 etc. Do not print the step. Only Print output of the step with the following title: ==alternatives for each entity== 

Step 5: Re-run Step 4 if all the distinct objects/devices/components/parts/compositions/ranges for every specific entity from Step 4 are not logically and not technically correct in context of their specific entity actions from Step 3 and in context of text ####current invention####. Output only if the re-run is needed.

For each entity chosen from ####alternatives for each entity####, explain its specific entity action it'll need to accomplish that step.

Explicit explanations should cover all details for how every/all/each entity action from each/every/all step is accomplished by the entities leaving no room for assumptions or imaginations for a layman and a technical person. These explanations should cover as needed (a) all details of all parts/components needed to accomplish the entity actions in that step (b) details of the input and output from and to each entity to accomplish the entity action in that step (c) metrics of what's being measured by the entity towards the entity action, if at all, with a detailed explanation of the metrics involved etc and their use etc. (d) the 3 alternative entities from ####alternatives for each entity#### in the explanation of each step.

When introducing plurality, avoid the use of article "the". Every subsequent reference to a previously introduced entity should be prefaced "the" or "said" (some practitioners use "said" to refer to entities, and "the" for other features). Adjectives may be dropped in subsequent references of entities only if the reference to the entity is unambiguous: "supporting member" can be later referenced as "said member", but if the invention also includes an "oscillating member", subsequent references should be "said supporting member" and "said oscillating member". Importantly, do not add limiting adjectives in subsequent references as given in the example ("said horizontally supporting member"). A description paragraph may rely on itself for antecedent basis (e.g.: "a handle connected to the gear, the handle being axially aligned with the support member"). Do not remove the step numbers taken from step 9. Do not print output for this step.

Step 24: While writing the description in step 22, ensure to avoid profanity in the description generated in step 22 like "invention", "entity", "entities", "alternative of each entity", "layman", "implicit component", "technical write-up" and "entity action" etc. Also, avoid use of superlatives like "critical", "most important", "crucial" etc in Step 22 output.
