(1, 1, 1, 'claims_entities_prompt', 'system', 'I will provide you ####current invention####. Please write the claims for the current invention according to the instructions given below:

Step 1: identify all the entities from the text ####current invention####. Print the output of this step in the following format: ==entities== Entity 1; Entity 2 etc. 

Step 2: Identify all the specific numerical attributes, specific properties (including physical properties such as state, texture, etc. and particular examples), specific quantities from text ####current invention#### associated with each/every entity from {entities} . Use this format for output: ==specific_attributes== Entity 1 -> Specific Attributes; Entity 2 -> Specific Attributes etc.

Step 3: Use quantification for the entities identified as given in the examples 1 below
  Examples 1:
  Entity: processor  
  Quantification - one or more processors or at least one processor or a computer system that includes a processor
  Entity: file system 
  Quantification: one or more file system 
  Entity: computer-readable media  
  Quantification: one or more computer-readable media
  Entity: components  
  Quantification: plurality of components 
  Entity: modules  
  Quantification: plurality of modules or one or more modules
Use this format for output: ==entity_quantification== Entity 1 -> Quantification for Entity 1; Entity 2 -> Quantification for Entity 2....

Step 4: Generalise the language for all the entities from {entities} in context of text ####current invention####. Ensure the generalised language while broadening the scope of action retains the technical essence in context of #### current invention #### and is not vague. Use this format for Output: ==entity_generalised== Specific Entity 1 -> generalised Entity 1; Specific Entity 2 -> generalised Entity 2 etc. 

Step 5: Identify all the direct and indirect entity actions of all the entities from {entities} using text ####current invention####. Generalise the language for all entity actions from text #### current invention ####. Ensure the generalised language while broadening the scope of action retains the technical essence in context of #### current invention #### and is not vague. Use specifics for the entity actions from text ####current invention#### where necessary to avoid being vague. Use this format for output: ==entity_generalised_actions== Entity 1-> Action 1 -> generalised language for Action 1; Entity 1 -> Action 2 -> generalised language for Action 2 etc. 

Step 6: Identify the novelty of the invention from text ####current invention####. Identify entity actions from novelty that are necessary entity actions and entity actions that are optional. Use inputs for entities from {entity_generalised}, entity properties/attributes/quantities from {specific_attributes} and inputs for entity actions from {entity_generalised_actions}.  Print the output in the following format: ==Novelty==, ==necessary_features==, ==optional_features==

Step 7: Determine the entity actions from {entity_generalised_actions}, that are necessary in context of the novelty from {necessary_features}. Use this format for output: ==necessary_entity_action== Entity 1 -> Entity 1 action; entity 2 -> entity 2 action etc.

Step 8: Determine the additional features/actions of the entities from {entity_generalised_actions} and entity attributes/properties/quantities from {specific_attributes} not covered in {necessary_entity_action}. Use this format for output: ==additional_entity_action== Entity 1 -> Entity 1 action; Entity 2 -> entity 2 action etc.

Step 8.1: Co-relate the all the specific attributes from {specific_attributes} associated with each/every entity with the respective generalised entities from {entity_generalised}. Include all the details for all entities from {specific_attributes} in the output. Use this format for output: ==entity_attributes== Entity 1 -> generalised Entity 1 -> Entity 1 specific attributes from {specific_attributes}; Entity 2 -> generalised Entity 2 -> Entity 2 specicific attributes  from {specific_attributes} etc.

Step 9: You are a patent attorney. Your aim is to draft patent claims for text ####current invention #### by following Steps 10 to 29. When drafting claims, use the generalised language for all entities from {entities_generalised} and generalised language for entity actions from {entity_generalised_actions} without being vague. Use quantification of entities from {entity_quantification} . When writing a claim it is important to describe how the various entities are structured and how the various entities interact and connect.

Step 10: Draft independent claims for a method/system/ process/ apparatus/machine/device/product/composition etc. in context of novelty {novelty} using only the necessary features from {necessary_features}. Use the generalised language for entities from {entity_generalised} and generalised language for entity actions from {entity_generalised_actions} to write all the independent claims without being vague. 

Step 11: Draft additional independent claims for larger systems, using only the necessary features from {necessary_features} that encompass the invention to enhance damages in litigation. Use the generalised language for entities from {entity_generalised} and generalised entity actions from {entity_generalised_actions} to write all the independent claims without being vague. 

Step 12: Ensure all the independent claims are truly independent and not dependent on other claims. It is not allowed for Independent claims to reference any other claims. 

Step 13: For defining the borders of the invention with detailing and specificity, there can be the addition of dependent claims. The dependent claims should add specificity and specific details/attributes for entities using {entity_attributes} and entity actions from {necessary_entity_action}/{additional_entity_action} in context of the invention and not be vague. They should not repeat/recite entity actions mentioned in the independent claims. Use inputs for specific details/attributes of entities from from {entity_attributes}. Use inputs for entity action from {necessary_entity_action} and {additional_entity action}.  

Step 14: Write additional dependent claims using the additional features/actions of entities from {additional_entity_action} and not covered in the independent claims. Ensure specificity when reciting the features/actions from  {additional_entity_action} when used/in context of text ####current invention####. Use inputs from {entity_attributes} and {additional_entity_action} for this.  

Step 15: Please generate multiple dependent claims specifying the multiple possible ways for performing the entity actions in independent claims. Ensure they are not vague and specifically state specific entity characteristics/properties/actions/quantities. Etc. Use inputs from {entity_attributes} and {additional_entity_action} for this.  

Step 16: Ensure, the dependent claims reference the relevant independent claim on which it is dependent. Ensure, dependent claims reference only one independent claim on which it is dependent. Referencing more than one independent claim is not allowed.  

Step 17: Step Aim for 20 total claims, with 3 being independent, to avoid additional fees.

Step 18: Avoid "means for" or "steps" in claims to prevent invoking par. 112 issues.

Step 19:  Replace terms like "mechanism", "element", or "member" with terms conveying specific functions such as "coupler", "support", or "detector."

Step 20: Provide antecedent basis for entities used in all the claims and introduce features properly before reciting their functionality. Every entity or noun in the claim, when introduced, should be introduced by an article usually "a" or "an" and not article "the", except when introduced as a plurality or as "means".  When introducing plurality, avoid the use of article "the". Every subsequent reference to a previously introduced entity should be prefaced "the" or "said" (some practitioners use "said" to refer to entities, and "the" for other features). Adjectives may be dropped in subsequent references of entities only if the reference to the entity is unambiguous: "supporting member" can be later referenced as "said member", but if the invention also includes an "oscillating member", subsequent references should be "said supporting member" and "said oscillating member". Importantly, do not add limiting adjectives in subsequent references as given in the example ("said horizontally supporting member"). A claim may rely on itself for antecedent basis (e.g.: "a handle connected to the gear, the handle being axially aligned with the support member")

Step 21:  In claims with multiple options, use "or" instead of "and" for clarity and proper scope. 

Step 22:  Limit method claims to entity actions, not structures, and ensure dependent method claims are based on entity actions. Ensure the method claims are not vague. 

Step 23:  If entity actions from {entity_generalised_actions} recites quantities, use numerical approximation or a wider numerical range to convey the quantities in claims to broaden claim scope without being vague. 

Eg: Avoid stating quantity of a polymer as a “specific percentage of a polymer” as it is vague. 
Eg: Avoid stating the property of an entity by stating “possesses a certain degree of that property” as it is vague

Step 24: Avoid subjective language or language lacking measurable quantities in claims. Use inputs from {entity_attributes} to avoid subjective language or language lacking measurable quantities.  

Step 25:  Specify forces or quantities exerted on particular elements for clarity. Use inputs from {entity_attributes} to specify forces or quantities. 

Step 26: Remove redundant or unnecessary dependent claims. 

Step 27:  Review and edit claims for proper punctuation and formatting

Step 28: Group all claims in the proper order. Order all claims that depend on an independent claim before the next independent claim. 

Step 29: Avoid patent profanities such as:
29.1 Do not use words such as "Preferably" or "Such As": These words imply that the element of the claim that follows isn''t essential, and this could be interpreted to mean that it could be left out altogether. This may make it easier for a competitor to avoid infringement.
29.2 Do not use words such as "Necessary" or "Important": This could imply that without this element, the invention would not work. This could limit the claim to only those situations where that element is present.
29.3 Do not use "And/Or": This phrase can create ambiguity because it''s not clear whether it means "and", "or", or both.
29.4 Do Not use the word "About": This word can create uncertainty because it''s not clear how much variation is allowed.
29.5 Do not use "consists" of or "consisting of" and use "comprises" or "comprising" instead. The word "comprises" is often interpreted to mean "includes but is not limited to", and it generally does not limit the scope of a claim to the elements listed.  In contrast, "consists" or "consisting of" is more limiting and typically restricts the claim to the elements listed.
29.6 Do not use words such as: "absolute", "such as", "all", "each", "every ", "always" "never", "same", "identical", "exact", "minimum", "maximum", "no other", "only", "important", "critical", "essential", "required", "must", "Necessary"
29.7 Avoid words that are too vague and too exact:  "could", "might", "large", "small", "heavy", "above", "below", "right", "left", "superior", "inferior", "unique" etc.,
29.8    Avoid negative limitations, for example avoid using "without" and "not"
29.9  When describing a  quantity or number etc. try to add: "substantially" or "approximately", "about"
29.10 Avoid use of words like: "having", "including", "characterizing", "adapted to" or "adapted for" or "capable of"
29.11 Avoid annotations in claims to indicate a sequential order of steps. Do not annotate steps in a claim with language like "Step 1", "Step 2" etc. or "a", "b", "c" etc. Order of steps should not be specified to indicate a sequence of steps. 
29.12 In cases where multiple options are available, avoid the use of "or" or "and" between the options. Instead, qualify the options with "at least one a or b or c" or "one or more of a or b or c".', NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL),

I have also provided a mapping between the entities in claims, entity action from claims mapped to the entity actions in text ####current invention#### in text ####Entity action####. Format for this mapping is claim 1: Entity action in claims-entity action from current invention, claim 2: Entity action in claims-entity action from current invention etc. 

Step 3: If the text ####Claims#### include a system/software product/apparatus/device/machine claim, then perform steps 5 to 7.

Step 4: If the text ####Claims#### include a claim that is other than a system/software product/apparatus/device/machine claim (for example product or composition or method or process), do not do anything.

Step 5:  Identify the respective system/software product/apparatus/device/machine independent claim and other claims dependent on it from the text ####Claims####. Print the claim numbers only.

step 5.1:  From the output of step 5, and using entity action from text ####entity action####, identify which dependent claim depends on which entity action of the independent claim or the entity action in other dependent claims. Provide the mapping between the dependent claims and the claim entity actions of the independent claim or the entity actions of other dependent claims on which it depends. Output - Independent claim/dependent claim - dependent claim - reason etc. 

Step 5.2: Identify and name the system that encompasses the entity actions from text ####entity action#### and all the claims from Step 5.      

Step 5.3: Identify all the entities from all the claims from output of Step 5. Output: - Claim - Entities

Step 5.4: Group all the entities from from Step 5.3 from all the claims from Step 5 using using text ####generalized entities#### and text ####entity action####into unique components and sub-components. The grouping into unique components and sub-components should be based on all the entity actions/dependencies by/of all the entities from text ####generalized entities#### from all the claims from Step 5 using text ####entity action#### and output from Step 5.1. Remember, entities maybe referred by different names but may refer to the same entity - this can be determined using dependencies between the entities and their entity actions from text ####entity action####.

Step 5.5 - Ensure all the entities from Step 5.3 from all the claims from Step 5 are used in the grouping of components and sub-components in Step 5.4. 

Step 5.6 : Re-name the components and sub-components only If the components and sub-components from Step 5.4 to sound like method components. Do not rename if the component and sub-component from Step 5.4 already sound like system components and sub-components. Ensure the names are small/pithy/catchy titles with at most 2-5 words. Ensure the new names are unique and capture the essence of the component and sub-component entity action as mapped in output of Step 5.5

Step 5.7: Number the system, component and sub-component from the output of step 5.2 and step 5.6, in an even numbering series with increment of 2 for each step, as follows - if the system is 200, the component number is 202 - it''s sub-component number will be 202-a, 202-b, for  component 204 the sub-component will be 204-a, 204-b etc.

Ensure all entity actions from text ####entity action#### are co-related with all the components from Step 5.7 and all the components numbers are mentioned in the output. For every entity action, also extract the mathematical construct or parameters or metrics/measurements associated with it from text ####current invention####. For all entity actions from text ####entity action#### also extract all the definitions/explanations of every technical term in the entity action from text ####current invention####. Output - Claim 1:- entity action 1, all entity action details/definitions/parameters, components, entity action 2, all entity action details/definitions/parameters, components etc. Claim 2 : entity action 1, all entity action details/definitions/parameters, components, entity action 2, entity action entity action 1, all entity action details/definitions/parameters, components etc and so on for every claim

Step 1: Identify all the entities from the text  ####current invention####. Print the output of this step in the following format: ==entities== Entity 1; Entity 2 etc. 

Step 2: Identify all the specific numerical attributes, specific properties (including physical properties such as state, texture, etc. and particular examples), specific quantities from text ####current invention#### associated with each/every entity from {entities} . Use this format for output: ==specific_attributes== Entity 1 from {entities} -> Specific Attributes; Entity 2 from {entities}-> Specific Attributes etc.

Step 4: Generalise the language for the entities that are too specific from {entities} in context of text ####current invention####. Ensure the generalised language while broadening the scope of the entities is not vague and retains the technical essence in context of ####current invention####. Ensure the generalisation is only done for entities that are very specific and need to be generalised. Do not generalise the language of entities mentioned in a sequence. Ensure that the generalised name for all entities is unique and not repeated. Use this format for Output: ==entity_generalised== Entity 1 from {entities} -> generalisation needed yes/no -> generalised language for Entity 1 if yes; Entity 2 from {entities}-> generalisation needed yes/no -> generalised Entity 2 etc.

Step 4.1: Associate all entities from {entities} with its corresponding generalised form from {entity_generalised} and its specific attributes from {specific_attributes}. For each entity {from entities}, first list its specific attributes from {specific_attributes}, followed by its generalised form from {entity_generalised}. This format will help to maintain the technical essence of each entity while ensuring that all the details from {specific_attributes} are included accurately and the language remains non-generalised. Use this format for output:

==entity_attributes==
Entity 1 from {entities} ->
Specific Attributes: {attribute1}, {attribute2}, ... from {specific_attributes};
Generalised Form: generalised Entity 1 from {entity_generalised};
Entity 2 from {entities} ->
Specific Attributes: {attribute1}, {attribute2}, ... from {specific_attributes};
Generalised Form: generalised Entity 2 from {entity_generalised}; etc

Step 4.2: Ensure all the entities from {entities} are associated with its specific attributes from {specific_attributes} in output of Step 4.1. 

Step 5: Identify all the direct and indirect entity actions of all the entities from {entities} using text ####current invention####. Generalise the language for all entity actions from text #### current invention####. Ensure the generalised language while broadening the scope of action retains the technical essence in context of ####current invention#### and is not vague. Use specifics for the entity actions from text ####current invention#### where necessary to avoid being vague. Use this format for output: ==entity_generalised_actions== Entity 1 from {entities}-> Entity 1 Action 1 -> generalised language for Entity 1 Action; Entity 1 from {entities} -> Entity 1 Action 2 -> generalised language for Entity Action 2, Entity 2 from {entities} -> Entity 2 Action 1 -> generalised language for Entity 2 Action 1 etc. 

Step 6: Identify the novelty of the invention from text ####current invention####. Identify entity actions from novelty that are necessary entity actions and entity actions that are optional. Use inputs for entities from {entity_generalised}, entity properties/attributes/quantities from {specific_attributes} and inputs for entity actions from {entity_generalised_actions}.  Print the output in the following format: ==Novelty==, ==necessary_features==, ==optional_features==

(133, 4, 15, 'claims', 'user', 'Step 9: You are a patent attorney. Your aim is to draft patent claims for text ####current invention #### by following Steps 10 to 29. When drafting claims, use the generalised language for all entities from {entities_generalised} and generalised language for entity actions from {entity_generalised_actions} without being vague. When writing a claim it is important to describe how the various entities are structured and how the various entities interact and connect.

Step 10: Draft independent claims for a method/system/ process/ apparatus/machine/device/product/composition etc. in context of novelty {novelty} using only the necessary features from {necessary_features}. Use the generalised language for entities from {entity_generalised} and generalised language for entity actions from {entity_generalised_actions} to write all the independent claims without being vague. 

Step 11: Draft additional independent claims for larger systems, using only the necessary features from {necessary_features} that encompass the invention to enhance damages in litigation. Use the generalised language for entities from {entity_generalised} and generalised entity actions from {entity_generalised_actions} to write all the independent claims without being vague. 

Step 12: Ensure all the independent claims are truly independent and not dependent on other claims. It is not allowed for Independent claims to reference any other claims. 

Step 13: For defining the borders of the invention with detailing and specificity, there can be the addition of dependent claims. The dependent claims must specify the all the specific attributes and specific entity forms/names for all generalised entities from {entity_generalised} referenced in the independent claims using {entity_attributes}. {entity_attributes} stores the mapping between generalised entity from {entity_generalised} with it''s respective attributes from {specific_attributes} and specific entity form/name from {entities}. The dependent claims should not repeat/recite entity attributes/features already mentioned in the independent claims. 

Step 14: Write additional dependent claims using the additional features/actions of entities from {optional_features} and not covered in independent claims. 

Step 16: Ensure, the dependent claims reference the relevant independent claim on which it is dependent. Ensure, dependent claims reference only one independent claim on which it is dependent. Referencing more than one independent claim is not allowed.  

Step 17: Aim for 20 total claims, with 3 being independent, to avoid additional fees.

Step 18: Avoid "means for" or "steps" in all claims to prevent invoking par. 112 issues.

Step 19:  Replace terms like "mechanism", "element", or "member" with terms conveying specific functions such as "coupler", "support", or "detector."

Step 20: Provide antecedent basis for entities used in all the claims and introduce features properly before reciting their functionality. Every entity or noun in the claim, when introduced, should be introduced by an article usually "a" or "an" and not article "the", except when introduced as a plurality or as "means".  When introducing plurality, avoid the use of article "the". Every subsequent reference to a previously introduced entity should be prefaced "the" or "said" (some practitioners use "said" to refer to entities, and "the" for other features). Adjectives may be dropped in subsequent references of entities only if the reference to the entity is unambiguous: "supporting member" can be later referenced as "said member", but if the invention also includes an "oscillating member", subsequent references should be "said supporting member" and "said oscillating member". Importantly, do not add limiting adjectives in subsequent references as given in the example ("said horizontally supporting member"). A claim may rely on itself for antecedent basis (e.g.: "a handle connected to the gear, the handle being axially aligned with the support member")

Step 21:  In claims with multiple options, use "or" instead of "and" for clarity and proper scope. 

Step 22:  Limit method claims to entity actions, not structures, and ensure dependent method claims are based on entity actions. Ensure the method claims are not vague. 

Step 23: If entity actions from {entity_generalised_actions} recites quantities, use numerical approximation or a wider numerical range to convey the quantities in claims to broaden claim scope without being vague. 

Eg: Avoid stating quantity of a polymer as a “specific percentage of a polymer” as it is vague. 
Eg: Avoid stating the property of an entity by stating “possesses a certain degree of that property” as it is vague

Step 24: Avoid subjective language or language lacking measurable quantities in all the claims. Use inputs from {entity_attributes} to avoid subjective language or language lacking measurable quantities.  

Step 25:  Specify forces or quantities exerted on particular elements for clarity. Use inputs from {entity_attributes} to specify forces or quantities. 

Step 26: Remove redundant or unnecessary dependent claims. 

Step 27:  Review and edit claims for proper punctuation and formatting

Step 28: Group all the claims in the proper order. Order all claims that depend on an independent claim before the next independent claim. 

Step 29: Avoid patent profanities such as:
29.1 Do not use words such as "Preferably" or "Such As": These words imply that the element of the claim that follows isn''t essential, and this could be interpreted to mean that it could be left out altogether. This may make it easier for a competitor to avoid infringement.
29.2 Do not use words such as "Necessary" or "Important": This could imply that without this element, the invention would not work. This could limit the claim to only those situations where that element is present.
29.3 Do not use "And/Or": This phrase can create ambiguity because it''s not clear whether it means "and", "or", or both.
29.4 Do Not use the word "About": This word can create uncertainty because it''s not clear how much variation is allowed.
29.5 Do not use "consists" of or "consisting of" and use "comprises" or "comprising" instead. The word "comprises" is often interpreted to mean "includes but is not limited to", and it generally does not limit the scope of a claim to the elements listed.  In contrast, "consists" or "consisting of" is more limiting and typically restricts the claim to the elements listed.
29.6 Do not use words such as: "absolute", "such as", "all", "each", "every ", "always" "never", "same", "identical", "exact", "minimum", "maximum", "no other", "only", "important", "critical", "essential", "required", "must", "Necessary"
29.7 Avoid words that are too vague and too exact:  "could", "might", "large", "small", "heavy", "above", "below", "right", "left", "superior", "inferior", "unique" etc.,
29.8    Avoid negative limitations, for example avoid using "without" and "not"
29.9  When describing a  quantity or number etc. try to add: "substantially" or "approximately", "about"
29.10 Avoid use of words like: "having", "including", "characterizing", "adapted to" or "adapted for" or "capable of"
29.11 Avoid annotations in claims to indicate a sequential order of steps. Do not annotate steps in a claim with language like "Step 1", "Step 2" etc. or "a", "b", "c" etc. Order of steps should not be specified to indicate a sequence of steps.

Step 5.5 - Ensure all the entities from all the claims from Step 5.3 are used in the grouping of components and sub-components in Step 5.4 and referred in the output from Step 5.4. 


Step 5.6 : Check the naming of components from Step 5.4 to determine which components are named like method components. Re-name only the components and sub-components from output of Step 5.4 to sound like system components if they sound like method components. When renaming, ensure the names are small/pithy/catchy titles with at most 2-5 words.

Step 2: Identify all the specific numerical attributes, specific properties (including physical properties such as state, texture, etc. and particular examples), specific quantities from text ####current invention#### associated with each/every entity from {entities} . Use this format for output: ==specific_attributes== Entity 1 from {entities} -> Specific Attributes; Entity 2 from {entities}-> Specific Attributes etc.

Step 3: Identify all the entities from {entities} where (a) the sequence or order is associated with the entity and (b) where that sequence is important in context of ####current invention####. Output: ==entities_with_sequence==. 
Examples of words that mention sequence or order of entities are words like first, second etc. 

Step 3.1: Identify only the entities from {entities} where the sequence or order does not matter in context of ####current invention####. Ensure entities from ==entities_with_sequence== is not repeated here. Output: ==entities_without_sequence==

Step 4: Generalise the language for all the entities that are specific from {entities_without_sequence} in context of text ####current invention####. Ensure the generalised language while broadening the scope of the action of {entities_without_sequence} is not vague and retains the technical essence of the entities in context of ####current invention####. Ensure the generalised language for entities from {entities_without_sequence} allows one to distinguish one entity from the other. Use this format for Output: ==entity_generalised== Entity 1 from {entities_without_sequence} -> generalisation needed yes/no -> generalised language for Entity 1 if yes; Entity 2 from {entities_without_sequence}-> generalisation needed yes/no -> generalised Entity 2 etc.,

Step 4.1: Do not generalise the language of all the entities mentioning a sequence from {entities_with_sequence}. Use this format for Output: ==entity_generalised_sequence== Entity 1 from {entities_with_sequence} -> generalisation needed yes/no -> generalised language with sequence information for Entity 1 , Entity 2 from {entities_with_sequence} -> generalisation needed yes/no -> generalised language for Entity 2 with sequence information etc. 

Step 4.2: co-relate/Clearly associate each entity from {entities} with the corresponding generalised entity form {entity_generalised} or  {entity_generalised_sequence} and its respective specific attributes from {specific_attributes}. For each entity from {entities}, first list its specific attributes from {specific_attributes}, followed by its generalised form from {entity_generalised} or {entity_generalised_sequence}. This format will help to maintain the technical essence of each entity while ensuring that all the details from {specific_attributes} are included accurately and the language remains non-generalised. Use this format for output:
==entity_attributes==
Entity 1 from {entities} ->
Specific Attributes: {attribute1}, {attribute2}, ... from {specific_attributes};
Generalised Form: generalised Entity 1 from {entity_generalised} or from {entity_generalised_sequence};
Entity 2 from {entities} ->
Specific Attributes: {attribute1}, {attribute2}, ... from {specific_attributes};
Generalised Form: generalised Entity 1 from {entity_generalised} or from {entity_generalised_sequence}; etc

Step 5: Identify all the direct and indirect entity actions of all the entities from {entities} using text ####current invention####. Generalise the language for all entity actions from text ####current invention####. Ensure the generalised language while broadening the scope of action retains the technical essence in context of ####current invention#### and is not vague. Use specifics for the entity actions from text ####current invention#### where necessary to avoid being vague.

(215, 3, 28, 'claims', 'user', 'Step 9: You are a patent attorney. Your aim is to draft patent claims for text ####current invention#### by following Steps 10 to 29. When drafting claims, use the generalised language for all entities from {entity_generalised} or {entity_generalised_sequence} and generalised language for entity actions from {entity_generalised_actions} without being vague. When writing a claim it is important to describe how the various entities are structured and how the various entities interact and connect.

Step 10: Draft independent claims for a method/system/ process/ apparatus/machine/device/product/composition etc. in context of novelty {novelty} using only the necessary features from {necessary_features}. Use the generalised language for entities from {entity_generalised} or {entity_generalised_sequence} and generalised language for entity actions from {entity_generalised_actions} to write all the independent claims without being vague. 

Step 11: Draft additional independent claims for larger systems, using only the necessary features from {necessary_features} that encompass the invention to enhance damages in litigation. Use the generalised language for entities from {entity_generalised} or {entity_generalised_sequence} and generalised entity actions from {entity_generalised_actions} to write all the independent claims without being vague. 

Step 12: Ensure all the independent claims are truly independent and not dependent on other claims. It is not allowed for Independent claims to reference any other claims. 

Step 13: For defining the borders of the invention with detailing and specificity, there can be the addition of dependent claims. The dependent claims must specify all the {specific_attributes} and specific entity forms/names for all generalised entities from {entity_generalised} or {entity_generalised_sequence} referenced in the independent claims using {entity_attributes}. {entity_attributes} stores the mapping between generalised entity from {entity_generalised} or {entity_generalised_sequence} with it''s respective attributes from {specific_attributes} and specific entity form/name from {entities}. The dependent claims should not repeat/recite entity attributes/features already mentioned in the independent claims. 

Step 14: Write additional dependent claims using the additional features/actions of entities from {optional_features} and not covered in independent claims. 

Step 16: Ensure, the dependent claims reference the relevant independent claim on which it is dependent. Ensure, dependent claims reference only one independent claim on which it is dependent. Referencing more than one independent claim is not allowed. It is preferred that the dependent claims reference only the independent claims. Referencing other dependent claims is not preferred.   

Step 17: Aim for 20 total claims, with 3 being independent, to avoid additional fees.

Step 18: Avoid "means for" or "steps" in all claims to prevent invoking par. 112 issues.

Step 19:  Replace terms like "mechanism", "element", or "member" with terms conveying specific functions such as "coupler", "support", or "detector."

Step 20: Provide antecedent basis for entities used in all the claims and introduce features properly before reciting their functionality. Every entity or noun in the claim, when introduced, should be introduced by an article usually "a" or "an" and not article "the", except when introduced as a plurality or as "means".  When introducing plurality, avoid the use of article "the". Every subsequent reference to a previously introduced entity should be prefaced "the" or "said" (some practitioners use "said" to refer to entities, and "the" for other features). Adjectives may be dropped in subsequent references of entities only if the reference to the entity is unambiguous: "supporting member" can be later referenced as "said member", but if the invention also includes an "oscillating member", subsequent references should be "said supporting member" and "said oscillating member". Importantly, do not add limiting adjectives in subsequent references as given in the example ("said horizontally supporting member"). A claim may rely on itself for antecedent basis (e.g.: "a handle connected to the gear, the handle being axially aligned with the support member")

Step 21:  In claims with multiple options, use "or" instead of "and" for clarity and proper scope. 

Step 22:  Limit method claims to entity actions, not structures, and ensure dependent method claims are based on entity actions. Ensure the method claims are not vague. 

Step 23: If entity actions from {entity_generalised_actions} recites quantities, use numerical approximation or a wider numerical range to convey the quantities in claims to broaden claim scope without being vague. 

Eg: Avoid stating quantity of a polymer as a “specific percentage of a polymer” as it is vague. 
Eg: Avoid stating the property of an entity by stating “possesses a certain degree of that property” as it is vague

Step 24: Avoid subjective language or language lacking measurable quantities in all the claims. Use inputs from {entity_attributes} to avoid subjective language or language lacking measurable quantities.  

Step 25:  Specify forces or quantities exerted on particular elements for clarity. Use inputs from {entity_attributes} to specify forces or quantities. 

Step 26: Remove redundant or unnecessary dependent claims. 

Step 27:  Review and edit claims for proper punctuation and formatting

Step 28: Group all the claims in the proper order. Order all claims that depend on an independent claim before the next independent claim. 

Step 29: Avoid patent profanities such as:
29.1 Do not use words such as "Preferably" or "Such As": These words imply that the element of the claim that follows isn''t essential, and this could be interpreted to mean that it could be left out altogether. This may make it easier for a competitor to avoid infringement.
29.2 Do not use words such as "Necessary" or "Important": This could imply that without this element, the invention would not work. This could limit the claim to only those situations where that element is present.
29.3 Do not use "And/Or": This phrase can create ambiguity because it''s not clear whether it means "and", "or", or both.
29.4 Do Not use the word "About": This word can create uncertainty because it''s not clear how much variation is allowed.
29.5 Do not use "consists" of or "consisting of" and use "comprises" or "comprising" instead. The word "comprises" is often interpreted to mean "includes but is not limited to", and it generally does not limit the scope of a claim to the elements listed.  In contrast, "consists" or "consisting of" is more limiting and typically restricts the claim to the elements listed.
29.6 Do not use words such as: "absolute", "such as", "all", "each", "every ", "always" "never", "same", "identical", "exact", "minimum", "maximum", "no other", "only", "important", "critical", "essential", "required", "must", "Necessary"
29.7 Avoid words that are too vague and too exact:  "could", "might", "large", "small", "heavy", "above", "below", "right", "left", "superior", "inferior", "unique" etc.,
29.8    Avoid negative limitations, for example avoid using "without" and "not"
29.9  When describing a  quantity or number etc. try to add: "substantially" or "approximately", "about"
29.10 Avoid use of words like: "having", "including", "characterizing", "adapted to" or "adapted for" or "capable of"
29.11 Avoid annotations in claims to indicate a sequential order of steps. Do not annotate steps in a claim with language like "Step 1", "Step 2" etc. or "a", "b", "c" etc. Order of steps should not be specified to indicate a sequence of steps. 
29.12 In cases where multiple options are available, avoid the use of "or" or "and" between the options. Instead, qualify the options with "at least one a or b or c" or "one or more of a or b or c".

Then, using the characterising aspects of the invention from {characterising_elements}, draft the characterising portion of the claim. The characterising portion should clearly specify the novel features of the invention that distinguish it from the prior art and contribute to solving the technical problem. Ensure that the claim is structured to highlight the inventive step and aligns with the requirements of the European Patent Office. Do not use the any sub-titles in the claim draft. No explicit reference like previously known as is allowed. Pring Output in this format: ==independent_claim==

Step 12: Ensure that the independent claims from {independent_claims} are truly independent and not dependent on other claims. It is not allowed for Independent claims to reference any other claims. Do not print output for this step. 

Step 13: Ensure the {independent_claims} do not use phrases like "previously known"/ "pre-characterising", "characterising" aspects, etc. for entities or entity actions anywhere in the claims.  Do not print output for this step.   Step 13.1 Use the formatting style of following ####sample claim#### to modify the format of the claims generated in step 10 (format independent claims where one element is below the other element and avoid spacing between the elements of that claim). Print the formatted claims. Do not print step number   Sample claim:

(247, 8, 30, 'claims_europe_dependent', 'user', 'Step 14: Use {entity_attributes} for defining the borders of the invention with detailing and specificity by adding dependent claims. The dependent claims must specify all the specific attributes and specific entity forms/names for all generalised entities from {entity_generalised} referenced in the independent claims from {independent_claims}. {entity_attributes} stores the mapping between generalised entity from {entity_generalised} with it''s respective attributes from {specific_attributes} and specific entity form/name from {entities}. The dependent claims should not repeat/recite entity attributes/features already mentioned in the independent claims. 

Step 15: Write additional dependent claims using the additional features/actions of entities from {optional_features} and not covered in independent claims. 

Step 16: Ensure, the dependent claims reference the relevant independent claim on which it is dependent. Dependent claims can reference either a  independent claim on which it is dependent or other dependent claims. The dependent claim can depend on multiple claims.   

Step 17: Multiple dependent claims are allowed as per the EPO guidelines. 

Step 18: Ensure the dependent claims do not recite anything already recited/specified from {entity_attributes}in the {independent_claims}. 

Step 19:  Replace terms like "mechanism", "element", or "member" with terms conveying specific functions such as "coupler", "support", or "detector."

Step 20: Provide antecedent basis for entities used in all the claims and introduce features properly before reciting their functionality. Every entity or noun in the claim, when introduced, should be introduced by an article usually "a" or "an" and not article "the", except when introduced as a plurality or as "means".  When introducing plurality, avoid the use of article "the". Every subsequent reference to a previously introduced entity should be prefaced "the" or "said" (some practitioners use "said" to refer to entities, and "the" for other features). Adjectives may be dropped in subsequent references of entities only if the reference to the entity is unambiguous: "supporting member" can be later referenced as "said member", but if the invention also includes an "oscillating member", subsequent references should be "said supporting member" and "said oscillating member". Importantly, do not add limiting adjectives in subsequent references as given in the example ("said horizontally supporting member"). A claim may rely on itself for antecedent basis (e.g.: "a handle connected to the gear, the handle being axially aligned with the support member")

Step 21:  In claims with multiple options, use "or" instead of "and" for clarity and proper scope. 

Eg: Avoid stating quantity of a polymer as a “specific percentage of a polymer” as it is vague. 
Eg: Avoid stating the property of an entity by stating “possesses a certain degree of that property” as it is vague

Step 24: Avoid subjective language or language lacking measurable quantities in all the claims. Use inputs from {entity_attributes} to avoid subjective language or language lacking measurable quantities.  

Step 25:  Specify forces or quantities exerted on particular elements for clarity. Use inputs from {entity_attributes} to specify forces or quantities. 

Step 26: Remove redundant or unnecessary dependent claims. 

Step 27:  Review and edit claims for proper punctuation and formatting

Step 28: Group all the claims in the proper order. Order all claims that depend on an independent claim before the next independent claim. 

Step 29: Avoid patent profanities such as:
29.1 Do not use words such as "Preferably" or "Such As": These words imply that the element of the claim that follows isn''t essential, and this could be interpreted to mean that it could be left out altogether. This may make it easier for a competitor to avoid infringement.
29.2 Do not use words such as "Necessary" or "Important": This could imply that without this element, the invention would not work. This could limit the claim to only those situations where that element is present.
29.3 Do not use "And/Or": This phrase can create ambiguity because it''s not clear whether it means "and", "or", or both.
29.4 Do Not use the word "About": This word can create uncertainty because it''s not clear how much variation is allowed.
29.5 Do not use "consists" of or "consisting of" and use "comprises" or "comprising" instead. The word "comprises" is often interpreted to mean "includes but is not limited to", and it generally does not limit the scope of a claim to the elements listed.  In contrast, "consists" or "consisting of" is more limiting and typically restricts the claim to the elements listed.
29.6 Do not use words such as: "absolute", "such as", "all", "each", "every ", "always" "never", "same", "identical", "exact", "minimum", "maximum", "no other", "only", "important", "critical", "essential", "required", "must", "Necessary"
29.7 Avoid words that are too vague and too exact:  "could", "might", "large", "small", "heavy", "above", "below", "right", "left", "superior", "inferior", "unique" etc.,
29.8    Avoid negative limitations, for example avoid using "without" and "not"
29.9  When describing a  quantity or number etc. try to add: "substantially" or "approximately", "about"
29.10 Avoid use of words like: "having", "including", "characterizing", "adapted to" or "adapted for" or "capable of"
29.11 Avoid annotations in claims to indicate a sequential order of steps. Do not annotate steps in a claim with language like "Step 1", "Step 2" etc. or "a", "b", "c" etc. Order of steps should not be specified to indicate a sequence of steps. 
29.12 In cases where multiple options are available, avoid the use of "or" or "and" between the options. Instead, qualify the options with "at least one a or b or c" or "one or more of a or b or c".

Step 30: Aim for a total of 13 claims including one independent claim and other dependent claims.
